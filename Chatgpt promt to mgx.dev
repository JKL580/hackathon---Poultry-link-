I understand you want to build PoultryLink - a comprehensive digital platform for poultry farmers in Kenya with features including:
* Multi-role authentication (farmer, buyer, vet, admin)
* Knowledge hub with articles, videos, and guides
* Farming tools (feed calculator, ROI calculator)
* Marketplace for chicks, feeds, equipment
* Vet services directory with teleconsultation
* M-Pesa payment integration
* Multi-language support (English/Swahili)
* PWA support
This is a complex application that will require user authentication and data storage. Since Supabase is not currently enabled, I’ll create a demo version using localStorage for data persistence. For production use, you would want to enable Supabase for proper backend functionality.
Let me search for an appropriate template to get started.

Fine. I was thinking of solving issues surrounding poultry farming in kenya. My idea can extent to other sectors of agriculture but I want to start with poultry.  With hackathon coming and a project for a bootcamp in the corner,  I want to come up with a startup that will relieve my financial struggle but at the same time solving problems. 
The isssues surrounding farming in kenya are;
1. The people don't know the proper ways to keep chicken . Most people fear that the flock might die due to lack of proper management . In the facebook platform, there are opinions given by random people, so those looking to venture into rhe business don't know who to trust.  Can't we have a central place where people just get into my website and get the info they want? You know it's tiresome to scroll and go to youtube to search for the ways to keep chicken? Furthermore, suggest a way I can gather the information from these " advisors" and compile them in my wesbiste?
2. Another issue is ordering new flocks. The issue comes when one wants to get a flock of chicken . They don't know who to trust, the kind of breed to order, the kind of feed etc . Furthermore,  in their feeding they don't know the quantity to feed one chicken etc. We can have the calculator in the website for this
For the ordering of flock. Why can't I create a market place for brooders? Just in the same website
3. The farmers don't have proper touch with customers. Who to sell to . When they sell to local brokers, they are given low prices. That's manipulation. I want farmers to sell through my website by indicating the time the flock will be ready etc. That's facilitated in the website. There can be a link to the marketplace. The farmers  and the buyers can register also. I need connection with the hotels etc. Suggest the best way to catch this.  This can be regional based. In the registration,  I can enlist all the farmers an the nearest market, together with the quotation
4. The common diseases to flock is so bad. I need a directory where farmers can learn to manage their flock from day one to maturity. This includes images of affected  chicken etc. In the same website, I can make the farmer call the nearest vet. This calls for reaching out to vets in the several loactions. In the same website, I need to indicate the best practices and medications if illnesses,  even the natural way to cure and prevent. The major diseases etc and how to manage. This knowledge is so i indepth,remember I am not an agriculture student. I am a medical student just interested in agriculture.  Suggest where I will get the pieces of knowledge and compile them


Finally,  remember this idea is not bound to poultry only. It can be for all livestock in general.  Suggest a good kind of website or up. How my startup will loom like and how I can go about the software. I am soon finishing my software development course
On the competition,  I need to know a variety of websites or apps that resemble my idea either in kenya or international. I also need a good benchmark.  Enlist those companies. Suggest the market gaps

I want you to change the section for integrating the payment. It is supposed to  be in the cart section where the client just collects the materials from the market place then is added all together. Furthermore in the foremost page, have a background of a happy farmer probably enjoying because of our product  , I mean more aesthetics . Furthermore, the description needs to be captivating tp users. For instance " Welcome to poultry link where you learn how to farm, you learn how to manage animals in your farm, we help you sell your products , we help you reach to the market at a conducive price, we help you reach to the veterinary and teach you to manage diseases so that you don't lose your stock. We value you so much. Karibu sana". You don't have to say this exactly .of course make it more persuasive . Furthermore change the business name to be KUKUSmart . On the disease library, give me a section where I can Input images of exact diseases
